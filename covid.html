                <p>
                    CoronaVac, also known as the Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine, is an inactivated virus 
                    COVID-19 vaccine developed by the Chinese company Sinovac Biotech. It has been 
                    in Phase III clinical trials in Brazil, Chile, Indonesia, the Philippines, and 
                    Turkey. It relies on traditional technology similar to BBIBP-CorV and BBV152,
                     other inactivated-virus COVID-19 vaccines in Phase III trials. CoronaVac does
                    not need to be frozen, and both the vaccine and raw material for formulating 
                    the new doses could be transported and refrigerated at 2–8 °C (36–46 °F), 
                    temperatures at which flu vaccines are kept. Phase III results from Brazil 
                    submitted to Lancet showed 50.7% efficacy at preventing symptomatic infections,
                     83.7% effective in preventing mild cases needing treatment. The efficacy
                    against symptomatic infections is increased to 62.3% with an interval of 21 
                    days or more between the two doses.[10] Final Phase III results from Turkey 
                    announced on 3 March 2021 showed an efficacy of 83.5%.
                     Interim results in Indonesia were announced on 11 January 2021 with an 
                     efficacy of 65.3%. CoronaVac is being used in vaccination campaigns by 
                     certain countries in Asia, South America, North America, and Europe.
                      In April, Sinovac had a production capacity of 2 billion doses a year of
                       which 200 million doses had been delivered and an estimated 100 million 
                       doses administered globally. It is being produced separately in China,
                        Brazil, Indonesia, and Egypt.

                <h3>How does the Sinovac vaccine work?</h3>
                <p>
                    The Beijing-based biopharmaceutical company Sinovac is behind the CoronaVac, 
                    an inactivated vaccine. It works by using killed viral particles to expose 
                    the body's immune system to the virus without risking a serious disease response.
                    By comparison the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines being developed in the West are
                     mRNA vaccines. This means part of the coronavirus' genetic code is injected
                    into the body, triggering the body to begin making viral proteins, but not
                     the whole virus, which is enough to train the immune system to attack.
                    "CoronaVac is a more traditional method [of vaccine] that is successfully 
                    used in many well known vaccines like rabies," Associate Prof Luo Dahai of 
                    the Nanyang Technological University told the BBC.
                    "mRNA vaccines are a new type of vaccine and there is [currently] no successful 
                    example [of them] being used in the population," Prof Luo adds.
                    media caption How will the new Pfizer vaccine work?
                    On paper, one of Sinovac's main advantages is that it can be stored in a 
                    standard refrigerator at 2-8 degrees Celsius, like the Oxford vaccine, which 
                    is made from a genetically engineered virus that causes the common cold in 
                    chimpanzees.
                    Moderna's vaccine needs to be stored at -20C and Pfizer's vaccine at -70C.
                    It means that both Sinovac and the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine are a lot more 
                    useful to developing countries which might not be able to store large amounts 
                    of vaccine at such low temperatures.

                <p>
                    China's Sinovac vaccine is 50.7% effective against COVID-19, just reaching the 
                    threshold to be a vaccine worth using, a major trial showed. The COVID-19 
                    vaccine from Chinese biotech Sinovac is about 50% effective at preventing 
                    symptomatic coronavirus, a late-stage trial in Brazil showed.
                    The two-dose CoronaVac vaccine was safe and 50.7% effective against symptomatic 
                    COVID-19, Sinovac's Brazilian partner, Butantan, said in a preprint posted 
                    Sunday, confirming top-line results announced by the group in a press release 
                    in January.

                    China's Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine has 50.7 percent efficacy and has proved to be 
                    effective against the variants known as P1 and P2 that are prevalent in Brazil, 
                    latest data showed. Moreover, the Sinovac vaccine's efficacy rate can climb to 62.3 
                    percent with an interval of more than 21 days between doses rather than 14 days.
                    The findings appear in the latest report released on Sunday by Sao Paulo's 
                    state-owned Butantan Institute, which tested and produced Sinovac's COVID-19 
                    inactivated vaccine named CoronaVac. 
                    The report released specific and comprehensive data on late-stage trials in Brazil. 
                    This is the most detailed statistical report on a Chinese COVID-19 vaccine. 
                    The primary efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 is 50.7 percent. The vaccine 
                    is 83.7 percent effective in preventing cases requiring assistance, rising from
                     78 percent in data released in January. It is 100 percent effective against
                      moderate and severe cases in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
                      phase III clinical trial involving 12,396 participants, the statistics revealed. 
                    The efficacy rates revealed in this report are slightly higher than those 
                    reported in early January, due to tracking changes of clinical data and the 
                    different criteria used to define infection cases, spokesperson Liu Peicheng of 
                    Sinovac told the Global Times on Monday.

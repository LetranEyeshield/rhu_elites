                <h3>Philippine Plan of Action for Nutrition (PPAN)</h3>
                <p>
                    The Philippine Plan of Action for Nutrition (PPAN), 2011-2016 is the country's
                     response to malnutrition.  An integral component and as a companion plan of 
                     the Philippine Development Plan (PDP), 2011-2016, PPAN provides the framework 
                     for improving the nutritional status of Filipinos.  The NNC believes that 
                     nutrition should and would have influence and would be influenced by other 
                     concerns in the PDP -- from pursuit of inclusive growth to macroeconomic 
                     policy, industry, agriculture and fisheries, infrastructure, governance, 
                     peace and security, and environment and natural resources.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    The PPAN, like the PDP is also anchored on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs),
                    particularly those related to nutrition that targets halving the 1990 levels of 
                    underweight among under-fives and or households with inadequate energy intake.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The PPAN takes off from the nutrition situation as determined by the 2008
                     national nutrition survey and in essence, there is a need to catch up with
                      many of the targets, and at the same time sustain and protect gains already 
                      achieved. The PPAN presents the following challenges that should be addressed:
                      <ul class="nutrition-section-ul">
                            <li>1. Hunger</li>
                            <li>2. Child undernutrition</li>
                            <li>3. Maternal undernutrition</li>
                            <li>4. Deficiencies in iron, iodine and vitamin A</li>
                            <li>5. Obesity and overweight</li>
                      </ul>
                       
                    The PPAN 2011-2016 aims to address the nutrition situation, providing a 
                    guide for all who want to be involved in nutrition action. It lays out 
                    targets, directions, and priority actions, among others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Actions to address nutritional problems and achieve the targets will be based 
                    on several guiding principles, that include, among others, a human-rights 
                    perspective that recognizes that good nutrition is a basic human right. 
                    As such, each Filipino and Filipino family, as claim holders are responsible 
                    for the attainment of the nutritional well-being of the families and family 
                    members. Government and others in the development sector, as duty bearers, 
                    have the responsibility to assist those who are unable as of yet to enjoy the 
                    right to good nutrition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The PPAN builds on past national plans. Many nurition and related interventions 
                    have been implemented in the past with varying degrees of success. The current 
                    PPAN builds on these experiences to identify a mix of strategies and 
                    interventions.

                    <p>
                        The Barangay Nutrition Scholar (BNS) Program is a human resource development 
                        strategy of the Philippine Plan of Action for Nutrition, which involves the 
                        recruitment, training, deployment and supervision of volunteer workers called 
                        the Barangay Nutrition Scholars (BNS).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Presidential Decree No. 1569 (1979) mandated the deployment of at least one (1) 
                        BNS in every barangay in the country to monitor the nutritional status of 
                        children and other nutritionally at-risk groups and link them with nutrition 
                        and nutrition-related service providers. PD 1569 also mandated the NNC to 
                        administer the program in cooperation with local government units.
                    </p>

                        <strong>Qualifications of a Barangay Nutrition Scholar</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A BNS is a trained volunteer community worker with the following qualifications:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="nutrition-section-ul">
                        <li>•	Bonafide resident of the barangay for at least four years and can speak the local language;</li>
                        <li>•	Possess leadership potentials as evidenced by membership and leadership in community organizations;</li>
                        <li>•	Willing to serve the barangay, part-time or full-time for at least one year;</li>
                        <li>•	At least elementary graduate but preferably has reached high school level;</li>
                        <li>•	Physically and mentally fit;</li>
                        <li>•	More than 18 years old, but younger than 60 years old.</li>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Training</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To prepare a potential BNS for deployment in his/her barangay, a BNS 
                        should undergo a training under the supervision of the District/City 
                        Nutrition Program Coordinator or the designated BNS trainer-supervisor.  
                        The training combines didactic training and twenty (20) days practicum. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The training facilitates the acquisition of knowledge, attitudes, and skills 
                        needed for effective performance of the tasks of identifying the malnourished,
                        monitoring the malnourished, and referring them to appropriate service providers. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After the didactic phase, the BNS undergoes a twenty-day practicum to learn 
                        how to weigh and measure the height or length of preschoolers properly and 
                        interview mothers on matters which may relate to their child-rearing practices. 
                        During this phase, the BNS collects and analyzes data on the barangay nutrition 
                        situation using the family and barangay profile forms.  He or she also 
                        formulates his or her BNS action plan. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The BNS trainer-supervisor or the district/city nutrition program coordinator 
                        (D/CNPC) organizes, conducts, and supervises the training.  In the absence 
                        of the D/CNPC, the nutrition action officer (NAO) assumes these responsibilities.
                        To reinforce skills during the formal training, BNSs also attend monthly meetings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During these meetings, the D/CNPC or NAO provides more information on proper 
                        weighing and height/length-taking and record keeping, good nutrition, 
                        breastfeeding or other information to update their knowledge and skills.
                        The D/CNPC or NAO visits the BNS regularly observing and encouraging the 
                        BNS to do his/her tasks correctly.
                    </p>
                    <h4>The Basic Tasks of the BNS   </h4>
                    <p><strong>• Caring for the malnourished</strong></p>
                    <p>The BNS locates and identifies malnourished children through a community 
                        survey referred to as the Operation Timbang Plus. This survey involves
                        weighing and measuring the length or height of all preschoolers and 
                        interviewing mothers to determine how the child is cared for, and the 
                        resources available in the family and their participation in nutrition 
                        and related interventions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Based on the results of the annual OPT Plus activity,  the BNS also weighs
                        monthly all undernourished preschoolers. The BNS also monitors the growth 
                        of all 0-23 month-old children to monitor if the children are reaching 
                        their growth targets according to the accepted child growth standard.  
                        The BNS also does a quarterly follow-up weighing of children, 24-59 months old, 
                        to monitor any growth faltering and determine any need for counselling of 
                        parents and/or care givers or referral to appropriate service providers.
                    </p>
                    <h4>•	Mobilizing the community</h4>
                    <p>
                        The BNS also engages the community to action by organizing families into 
                        clusters of 20-25 households, or into community-based organizations 
                        working and helping the barangay to improve the nutrition situation 
                        among the vulnerable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>•	Linkage-building</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With the barangay masterlist of wasted, stunted, under- and overweight 
                        children, pregnant and lactating mothers, the BNS links the people needing 
                        nutrition intervention and the barangay service providers.  Thus, part of 
                        the BNS training is to learn the various nutrition interventions and the 
                        various workers in the barangay.  In addition, the BNS performs other 
                        specific tasks, including organizing community nutrition activities and 
                        sharing nutrition information in the community.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>•	Other forms of BNS assistance</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The BNS assists in delivering nutrition and related services which include: 
                    </p>
                    <ul class="nutrition-section-ul">

                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        <strong>•	Keeping Records</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To help other barangay workers and the local officials, the BNS keeps a 
                        record of the results of the regular nutritional assessment as well as 
                        records on the nutrition and health profile of families in the barangay. 
                        The BNS also keeps records of the various nutrition programs and 
                        accomplishments of the barangay. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The BNS also formulates a BNS Action Plan as guide in managing her/his 
                        different tasks to support implementation of the Barangay Nutrition Action 
                        Plan.  To document her accomplishments as a BNS, he/she prepares a record 
                        of monthly accomplishments in relation the targets in the BNS action plan.  
                        The BNS also keeps track of his or her daily activities through a diary.  
                        The diary lists the BNS’ activities for the day, observations and insights 
                        as part of her/his on-the-job training and continuing education as a BNS.
                    </p>

                        <strong>Benefits</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The best reward of the BNS is the fulfillment of knowing that through 
                        his/her service and that of the other volunteer workers in the community, 
                        child illnesses and death due to malnutrition are prevented..  
                        In addition, the BNS receives some incentives too.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After completing two consecutive years of satisfactory service, 
                        the BNS can avail of a first level eligibility by filing the proper 
                        application with the regional office of the Civil Service Commission (CSC). 
                        This gives the BNS a chance to become a full-pledged civil servant 
                        should the BNS qualify for a vacant position in the local government. 
                        Detailed requirements appear in the Civil Service Commission website.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition, a BNS receives a modest monthly traveling allowance from the 
                        NNC in Manila, and from provincial, city, municipal or barangay governments.
                        The amount of the allowance varies depending on the financial capability of 
                        the LGUs.  In addition, the NNC provides survivorship assistance for the 
                        families of deceased BNSs, and medical assistance to BNSs who have been
                         confined in a medical facility.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Newly trained BNSs also receive from NNC,  a bag, a t-shirt and a set of 
                        nutrition information materials to be shared with the other members of the 
                        community. BNSs also receive various material incentives like uniform, 
                        jacket, etc. from the LGU.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When the BNS does his/her work well, he/she could be chosen as an 
                        outstanding BNS in the municipality, city, province or region; and 
                        may even be chosen as the National Outstanding BNS. The NOBNS is 
                        recognized annually during the National Nutrition Awarding Ceremony.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition, BNSs who have rendered at least two years of satisfactory 
                        service to his/her barangay may apply for second grade eligibility from 
                        the Civil Service Commission.   To apply to the CSC for the eligibility,

                        name in the NNC’s database.  Requirements for issuance of this 
                        authentication include:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="nutrition-section-ul">
                        <li>•	Original endorsement letter from local chief executive</li>
                        <li>•	Original endorsement letter from the NNC regional office</li>

                    <p>
                        Once the authentication from BNS is granted, this is submitted to CSC 
                        together with the other eligibility requirements of CSC.
                        To date, a total of 49,779 BNSs are deployed in 39,942 barangays nationwide.
